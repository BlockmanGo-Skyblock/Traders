Continue building my Blockman Go Skyblock trading forum. The current version has login, register, trade post creation, and basic profile logic. I now want to add the following features to improve the experience:

🔁 Trade Post Cooldown
Add a cooldown of 10 minutes per user between trade posts.

Store the timestamp of the last trade posted by the user and prevent posting if within 10 minutes.

Show a friendly error if they try to post too soon.

✅ Accept / Decline Trade System
Add “Accept” and “Decline” buttons on each trade visible to other users (not the owner).

Once a trade is accepted:

Create a real-time private chat page for both users.

Mark the trade as “Accepted”.

If declined, mark trade as “Declined” and disable further interaction.

💬 Real-Time Trade Chat
When a trade is accepted, redirect both users to a chat page unique to that trade.

Use WebSocket (or Firebase Realtime DB if preferred) to enable real-time messaging.

Store chat messages in the database, linked to the trade ID and user IDs.

Only allow participants of the trade to access the chat.

🌍 Region-Based Trading
When a user registers, add a dropdown for choosing their region (e.g., Asia, EU, NA, SA).

Store the region in their profile.

In trade creation, auto-tag trades with the user's region.

In trade feed and search:

Only show trades from the same region as the logged-in user.

Disable or hide trades from other regions.

🧾 Completed Trade History
When either user marks a trade as “Completed” in the chat:

Add the trade to both users’ completed trades list.

Add a prompt to rate the trade (1–5 stars) and leave a comment.

Store this feedback in the database.

🧑 User Profile Page Enhancements
Clickable profile avatars that lead to a user’s public profile page.

Show:

Username and avatar

Region

Reputation rating (average of completed trade feedback)

All comments left by other users

List of completed trades with titles and dates

⭐ Rating System
After each completed trade, prompt both users to:

Leave a 1–5 star rating

Write a short comment or feedback

Show average rating next to usernames site-wide.

Add star icons and latest reviews on the user profile page.

📷 Trade Screenshots
Allow image upload (1–3 images max) when creating a trade.

Use Replit’s file system or a CDN to store them.

Show image thumbnails on the trade cards and full-size previews when clicked.

🛑 Final Notes
Keep everything secure and region-restricted.

Make sure cooldowns, user actions (accept/decline), and chats are locked to logged-in users only.

Profile pages, trade posts, and chats must all stay region-aware and auth-protected.

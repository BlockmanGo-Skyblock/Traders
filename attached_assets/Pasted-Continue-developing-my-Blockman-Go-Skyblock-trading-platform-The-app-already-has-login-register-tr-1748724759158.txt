Continue developing my Blockman Go Skyblock trading platform. The app already has login/register, trade creation, profiles, and regional restrictions. I want you to implement these next features exactly as described:

🧠 CORE ENHANCEMENTS
Delete Own Trades Only

Users should be able to delete their own trades, but not edit them.

Add a "Delete Trade" button visible only to the author.

Accept / Decline with Offer Chat

Keep the Accept/Decline system.

Once a trade is accepted, create a private real-time chat page (WebSocket or Firebase).

Allow users to send counter-offers before accepting.

Only allow trade owners and responders to view that chat.

Web/Crome Notifications

Add browser-based push notifications for:

New message in trade chat

Trade accepted

Trade completed

Ask for notification permission when user logs in.

❌ No Favorites/Watchlist (skip this).

Progressive Web App (PWA) Support

Make the site installable on mobile with a home screen icon.

Offline caching support for the homepage and trade feed.

🛡️ TRUST, SAFETY & MODERATION
Trade Reporting System

Add “Report Trade” with reasons (Scam, Fake Info, Wrong Region, Harassment).

Send reports to a special admin dashboard.

Admin username is @xSoniteALT – only this user can access the report list.

Close Trade Option

Add “Close Trade” button for owners.

This marks the trade as inactive and hides it from search/feed.

Auto-ban for Spam/Violations

Add detection for:

Excessive trade spam (bypassing cooldown)

Multiple failed login attempts

Warn user first, then block their actions temporarily.

Verified Trader Badge

Admin-only feature. Allow @xSoniteALT to manually mark trusted users as “Verified”.

Show badge on their profile and trade cards.

🫂 COMMUNITY & ENGAGEMENT
Forum / Comment Section

Create a separate “Community” section for:

Tips, discussions, Q&A

Guides and general chat

Allow posts and replies. Sorted by most recent.

Trader Leaderboard

Make a separate page showing:

Top traders by rating or number of completed trades.

Region-based sorting.

❌ No marketplace stats (skip this).

❌ No invite system (skip this).

🔧 ADDITIONAL FEATURES
✅ User Profile Pages

Clicking on a user's avatar or name should lead to a full profile page.

Show:

Their region

Reputation (star rating)

All received comments

List of completed trades

✅ View Incoming Offers

On each trade, allow users to see who sent them offers (if applicable) with timestamps.

Useful for deciding who to accept.

✅ Theme Toggle

Add a toggle button to switch between dark mode (default) and light mode (white UI).

Store user preference using cookies or localStorage.

Please build these features step-by-step and keep functionality protected by auth. Make sure @xSoniteALT has proper admin access. Let me know once everything is done so I can test each one.
